				  Thermometer


Review Question 1 (Cost Analysis):

Assume we are building 1000 units of this system.  Use the provided part
numbers (see the webpage) and the digikey.com or jameco.com website to find the
total **cost per unit** (again assume we build a quantity of 1000 units) for
these thermometers.  Itemize the part costs (list each part and its
unit cost when bought in units of 1000) and then show the final cost per unit
below.  Note: You only need to price the components used in the project (not
all the components in your lab kit.  Also, you do not need to account for the
cost of the circuit board or wires. In a real environment we would manufacture
a PCB (Printed Circuit Board). As an optional task, you can search online for
PCB manufacturers and what the costs and options are in creating a PCB.


Review Question 2 (Health/Safety/Reliability)

Assume this system was to be sold to consumers for use at their home.

Considering reliability, health, and safety...

 - What scenarios might you suggest testing (considering both HW and SW) 
    before releasing the product for use? 




 - How might you make your design more reliable? By reliability we don't just
   mean keeping it running correctly (though you should consider that), but
   also how you can detect that a connected component has failed to gracefully
   handle such situations.  You can consider both HW and SW points of failure,
   issues related to the operational environment, etc. and how to mitigate
   those cases.
